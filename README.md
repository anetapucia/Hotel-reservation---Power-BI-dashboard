# Hotel reservations - Power BI dashboard

Dashboard created as a challenge with community DataAcolyte. Dataset from Kaggle. 
I answered questions like: 
- What is a Cancellationa rate?
- What are the most populat days / months to arrive?
- What is the average lead time (how many days from booking to arrival)?

For data cleaning I had to remove records with the wrong date - there was no 29th of February 2018.
